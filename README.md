# Specialization-Assignment2
2nd Assignment of Specialization Course


This is the 2nd Assignment for the Google Coursera Specilization course. It show histograms and Kernal Density estimates for each ethnicity Behavorial Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Report conducted and reported by the CDC. The x-axis gives the income levels in the variables listed in the BRFSS Codebook. They are as follows:
2 - <$10,000
3 - <$15,000
4 - <$20,000
5 - <$25,000
6 - <$35,000
7 - <$50,000
8 - <$75,000
9 - >$75,000

If I had more time I would have preferred to list these values instead of the numbers given in the codebook.
All coding and visualizations done in RStudio
